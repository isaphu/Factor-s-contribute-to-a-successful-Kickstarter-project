# Factors contribute to a successful Kickstarter project
This repo contain a jupyter notebook where I have analyzed for factors contribute to a suceess Kickstarter project.

## For this analysis I have used the following Python libraries:

1) Numpy 
2) Pandas
3) Seaborn
4) Matplotlib 

I have chosen this datasets to help those who wanted to launch their campaign on Kickstarter. The result is as follow:

1. The average pledge goal is approximately around $5,480, setting higher goal than $10,000 might lead to a failure project.
2. Music in general or Indie rock are two of the most successful funded project.
3. Most of the project were funded when launching in May on Saturday.

In this repository are my jupyter notebook where you can look for the code, basic analysis and visualization. The second file is the dataset from Kaggle. 

I'd like to thanks Kaggle for the datasets and medium as a platform to share my analysis.
